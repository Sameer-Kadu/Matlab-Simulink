 --What is MATLAB--

-MATLAB stands for Matrices Laboratory it's a high performance
 language for technical computing. It integrates computation,
 visualization and programming algorithms in an easy to use environment.

-It's different than any other programming language because MATLAB is
 mostly for mathematics and it uses the programming by matrices.
 
-MATLAB is used in academia so if you're doing a researach most probably
 you will use MATLAB it's also used in different engineering fields, 
 economics, finance and so on.

--What MATLAB can do--

-Solve mathematical problems.
-Code programs and build algorithms.
 

--The MATLAB system--

-The MATLAB system consists of 5 main parts:
1.The MATLAB language.
2.The MATLAB working environment.
3.Hndle Graphics.
4.The MATLAB mathematical function library.
5.The MATLAB Application Program Interface (API).
